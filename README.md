# Cloud Computing Labs

Selected labs from my **Cloud Computing for Data Science** course.

This repo collects small, focused projects exploring topics like:

- REST APIs and microservices
- Containers and Docker
- Cloud storage and file handling
- Message queues and basic orchestration
- PySpark-based data processing

Each lab lives in its own folder with its own notebook and brief notes.
